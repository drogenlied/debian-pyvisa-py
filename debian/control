Description: Backend that implements a large part of the VISA in pure Python 3
 This library provides Python VISA bindings for GPIB, RS232, and USB
 instruments.
 .
 PyVISA started as wrapper for the NI-VISA library and therefore you need to
 install National Instruments VISA library in your system. This works most of
 the time, for most people. But NI-VISA is a proprietary library that only works
 on certain systems. That is when PyVISA-py jumps in.
 .
 This package provides Python 3 bindings for pyvisa-py.
