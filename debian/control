Package: python-pyvisa-py

Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}, python-pyvisa (>= 1.8-1)
Description: Backend that implements a large part of the VISA in pure Python
 This library provides Python VISA bindings for GPIB, RS232, and USB
 instruments.
 .
 PyVISA started as wrapper for the NI-VISA library and therefore you need to
 install National Instruments VISA library in your system. This works most of
 the time, for most people. But NI-VISA is a proprietary library that only works
 on certain systems. That is when PyVISA-py jumps in.
